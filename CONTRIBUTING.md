##  Contribution Areas & Low-Hanging Fruits

We have flagged the following high-priority areas for new contributors to pick up:

### 1. Middleware & Telemetry
* **Prometheus Integration:** Expose execution time, cache hit ratios, and routing margins.
* **OpenTelemetry Middleware:** Add trace propagation across tool execution boundaries.

### 2. Provider Adapters
* **Python Framework Wrappers:** Write production-ready client wrappers for LiveKit Agents and Pipecat pipelines.
* **JS/TS SDK Integration:** Build a lightweight TypeScript wrapper mirroring tool execution requests.

### 3. Routing Strategies
* **Custom LLM Selector Adapters:** Add built-in selector modules for OpenAI, Anthropic, or Hugging Face.
* **Advanced Lexical Search:** Explore alternative lexical algorithms (e.g. TF-IDF adjustments).
